# Authentication Setup Complete

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Project Structure**
- Migrated from single App.tsx to Expo Router file-based routing
- Created authentication flow with protected routes
- Set up tab-based navigation for authenticated users

### 2. **Authentication Flow**
- **Sign In Screen** (`app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`)
  - Email/password authentication
  - OAuth support (Google and Apple)
  - Proper error handling and loading states
  
- **Sign Up Screen** (`app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx`)
  - User registration with email verification
  - First name, last name, email, and password fields
  - Email verification code flow
  
- **Onboarding Screen** (`app/(auth)/onboarding.tsx`)
  - Username/handle selection
  - Home city input
  - Interest selection (up to 5)
  - Completes user profile in Convex

### 3. **Navigation Structure**
```
app/
├── _layout.tsx          # Root layout with providers
├── index.tsx            # Entry point with auth routing
├── (auth)/              # Authentication screens
│   ├── _layout.tsx
│   ├── sign-in.tsx
│   ├── sign-up.tsx
│   └── onboarding.tsx
└── (tabs)/              # Main app screens (protected)
    ├── _layout.tsx
    ├── map.tsx          # Map view
    ├── hub.tsx          # City hub
    ├── groups.tsx       # User's groups
    ├── inbox.tsx        # Messages
    └── profile.tsx      # User profile with sign-out
```

### 4. **Convex Backend**

  - Complete data model for users, trips, groups, messages, etc.
  - Proper indexes for efficient queries

  - `getCurrentUser` - Gets current authenticated user
  - `completeOnboarding` - Sets up user profile
  - `updateUser` - Updates user information

- **HTTP Routes** (`convex/http.ts`)
  - Webhook endpoint for Clerk user events
  - Handles user creation/update/deletion

### 5. **Providers Setup**
- **ClerkProvider** (`providers/ClerkProvider.tsx`)
  - Integrates Clerk with Convex
  - Implements secure token storage
  - Manages authentication state

### 6. **Features**

## How to Test

1. **Start the Convex backend:**
   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```

2. **Start the Expo app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test the authentication flow:**
   - Open the app on your device/simulator
   - Try signing up with a new email
   - Complete email verification
   - Fill out the onboarding form
   - Explore the authenticated tabs
   - Test sign out from the profile tab

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in `.env.local`:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://fearless-woodpecker-565.convex.cloud
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=https://proper-civet-33.clerk.accounts.dev
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add Map functionality** - Integrate map library to show friend locations
2. **Implement Groups** - Create, join, and manage travel groups
3. **Add Chat** - Real-time messaging within groups
4. **Friend System** - Add friend requests and connections
5. **Trip Planning** - Allow users to create and share trips
6. **Push Notifications** - Set up notifications for group activities
7. **AI Integration** - Add activity recommendations

## Important Notes

- The app uses city-level location only (privacy-first approach)
- Authentication is required to access any features
- User data is stored securely in Convex with Clerk authentication
- All screens are responsive and support dark mode

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Make sure all environment variables are set correctly
2. Ensure Convex is running (`npx convex dev`)
3. Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start -c`
4. Check Clerk dashboard for proper configuration
5. Verify Convex deployment is active in the dashboard
